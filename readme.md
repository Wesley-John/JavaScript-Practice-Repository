## Credit Card Masker

Given a string of credit card numbers, return a masked version of it using the following constraints:

- The string will contain four sets of four digits (0-9), with all sets being separated by a single space, or a single hyphen (-).
- Replace all numbers, except the last four, with an asterisk (*).
- Leave the remaining characters unchanged.
For example, given "4012-8888-8888-1881" return "****-****-****-1881".
